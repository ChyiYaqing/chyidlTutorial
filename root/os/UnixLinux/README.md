# Unix/Linux Operating System 

The C standard library or **libc** is the standard library for the C programming language, as specified in the ANSI C standard. It was developed at the same time as the C library POSIX specification, which is a superset of it. Since ANSI C was adpted by the International Organization for Standardization, the C standard library is also called the ISO C library.
