Trees: Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data
structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.

Binary Tree Data Structure:
    A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree.

A Binary Tree node contains following parts:
    1) Data
    2) Poniter to left child
    3) Pointer to right child

The Maximum number of nodes at level 'l' of a binary tree is 2^(l-1)
The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h' is 2^(h+1) - 1
(height of a leaf is considered as 0)
In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of
level is Log2(N+1)

Types of Binary Tree:

Full Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children.
    In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
    (L = I + 1) Where L = Number of leaf nodes, I = Number of internal nodes

Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are
completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all
keys as left as possible

Perfect Binary Tree: A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal
nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is
O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.

A degenerate tree: A Tree where every internal node has one child.

Binary Search Tree: is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the
following properties:
    1) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the
    node's key
    2) The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than
    the node's key
    3) The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. There
    must be no duplicate nodes.

Binary Search Tree Delete:
    1) Node to be deleted is leaf : Simply remove from the tree
    2) Node to be deleted has only one child: Copy the child to the node and
    delete the child
    3) Node to be deleted has two children: Find inorder successor of the node.
    Copy contents of the inorder successor to the node and delete the inorder
    successor.
[inorder successor] is needed only when right child is not empty.

Write a Program to FInd the Maximum Depth or Height of a Tree:
    Recursively calculate height of left and right subtree of a node and assign
    height to the node as max of the heights of two children plus 1.
Below pseudo code:
    maxDepth()
    1. If tree is empty then return 0
    2. Else
        a) Get the max depth of left subtree recursively
            call maxDepth(tree->left-subtree)
        b) Get the max depth of right subtree recursively
            call maxDepth(tree->right-subtree)
        c) Get the max of max depths of left and right subtrees and
        add 1 to it for the current node.
            max_depth = max(max dept of left subtree,
            maxdepth of right subtree + 1)
        d) Return max_depth
