"""
A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving
heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of
finding a global optimum.In many problems, a greedy strategy does not usually
produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield
locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a
reasonable amount of time.

Activity Selection problem as our first example of Greedy algorithms.
    you are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the
    maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person,
    assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.
"""
# The foloowing implementation assume that the activities are laredy sorted
# according to their finished time


# Prints a maximum set of activities that can be done by a single person, one
# at a time
# n             --> Total number of activities
# start[]       --> An array that contains start time of all activities
# finish[]      --> An array that contains finished time of all activities
def printMaxActivities(start, finish):
    print("The following activities are selected")
    # The first activity is always selected
    i = 0
    print(i, end="->")
    # Consider reset of the activities
    for j in range(len(finish)):
        # If this activity has start time greater than or equal to the finish
        # time of previously selected activity, then select it.
        if start[j] >= finish[i]:
            print(j, end="->")
            i = j
