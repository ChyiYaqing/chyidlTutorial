Square root of an integer:

A Better Solution to do Binary Search:
    1) Start with 'start'=0, end ='x'
    2) Do following while 'start' is smaller than or equal to 'end'
        a) Compute 'mid' as start+ (end-start)//2
        b) Compare mid*mid with x
        c) If x is equal to mid*mid, return mid
        d) if x is greater, do binary search between mid+1 and end. In this
        case, we also update ans(Note that we need floor)
        e) If x is smaller, do binary search between start and mid

Find square root of number upto given precision using binary search
    Given a positive number n and precision p. find the square root of number
    upto p decimal places using binary search

    1) As the square root of number lies in range 0 <= squareRoot <= number,
    therefore, initialize start and end as: start=0, end=number.
    2) Compare the square of mid integer with the given number. If it is equal
    to the number, then we found our integral part, else look for the same in
    left or right side depending upon the scenario
    3) Once we are done with finding the integral part, start computing the
    fractional part.
    4) Initialie the increment variable by 0.1 and iteratively compute the
    fractional part upto p places. For each iteration, increment changes to
    1/10th of it's previous value.
    5) Finally return the answer computed.
