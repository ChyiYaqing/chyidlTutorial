In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type
of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The
process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman codein
an algorithm developed by David A.Huffman while he was a Sc.D.student at MID,
and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of
Minimum-Redundancy Codes"

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithms. The idea is to assign
variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are
based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent
character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the
largest code.

There are mainly two major parts in Huffman Coding
    1) Build a Huffman Tree from input characters
    2) Traverse the Huffman Tree and assign codes to characters

Build Huffman Tree:
    Input is array of unique characters along with their frequency of
    occurrences and out-put is Huffman Tree.
    1) Create a leaf node for each unique chracter and build a min heap of all
    leaf nodes

    2) Extract two nodes with the minimum frequency from the min heap

    3) Create a new internal node with frequency euqal to the sum of the two
    nodes frequencies. Make the first extracted node as its left child and the
    other extracted node as its right child. Add this node to the min heap.

    4) Repeat steps#2 and #3 until the heap contains only one node. The remain
    node is the root node and the tree is complete.
