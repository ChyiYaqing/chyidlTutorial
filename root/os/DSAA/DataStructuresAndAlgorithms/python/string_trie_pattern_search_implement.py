"""
In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree, radix tree or prefix
tree, is a kind of search tree - an ordered tree data structure used to store a
dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.

Trie | (Delete)
During delete operation we delete the key in bottom up manner using recursion.
The following are possible conditions when deleting key from trie.
    1) Key may not be there in trie. Delete operation should not modify trie
    2) Key present as unique key(no part of key contains another key (prefix),
    not the key itself is prefix of another key in trie). Delete all the nodes.
    3) Key is prefix key of another long key in trie. Unmark the leaf node.
    4) Key present in trie, having atlest one other key as prefix key. Delete
    nodes from end of key until first leaf node of longest prefix key.
