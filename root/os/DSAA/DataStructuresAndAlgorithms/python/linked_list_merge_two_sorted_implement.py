Merge two sorted Linked lists

Method 1 (Using Dummy Nodes)
    The Strategy here uses a temporary dummy node as the start of the result.
    The pointer Tail always points to the last node in the result list,
    so appending new nodes is easy.
    
    The dummy node gives tail something to point to initially when the result
    list is empty. This dummy node is efficient, since it is only temporary,
    and it is allocated in the stack. The loop proceeds, removing one node from
    'a' or 'b', and adding it to tail.

Method 2 (Using Recursion)
    Merge is one of those nice recursive problems where the recursive solution
    code is much cleanerthan the iterative code. You probably wouldn't want to
    use the recursive version for production code however, because it will use
    stack space which is proporional to the length of the lists.
