"""
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by
trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those
solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of
time.

Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers
searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem

There are three types of problems in backtracking
    1) Decision Problem -- In this, we search for a feasible solution.
    2) Optimization Problem -- In this, we search for the best solution.
    3) Enumeration Problem -- In this, we find all feasible solution.

The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so
that no two queens attack each other. For example, following is a solution for
8 Queen problem.
    1) Naive Algorithm -- Generate all possible configurations of queens on
    board and print a configuration that satisfies the given constraints.

while there are untried configurations
{
    generate the next configuration
    if queens don't attack in this configuration then
    {
        print this configuration
    }
}

    2) Backtracking Algorithm -- The idea is to place queens one by one in
    different columns, starting from the left-most column. When we place a
    queen in a column, we check for clashes with already placed queens. in
    the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, we mark
    this row and column as part of the solution. If we do not find such a row
    due ro clashes then we backtrack and return false.

1. Start in the left most column
2. If all quees are placed
    return true
3. Try all rows in the current column. Do following for every tried row.
    a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row then mark this
    [row,column] as aprt of the solution and recursively check if placing queen
    here leads to a solution.
    b) If placing the queen in [row, column] leads to a solution then return
    true.
    c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then unmark this
    [row, column] (Backtrack) and go to step (a) to try other rows.
4. If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger
    backtracking
