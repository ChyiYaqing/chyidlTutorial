"""
Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in
which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out(FIFO).

Operations on Queue:
    Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said
        to be an Overflow condition.
    Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same
        order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said
        to be an Underflow condition.
    Front: Get the front item from queue
    Rear: Get the last item from queue

Array implementation of Queue:
For implementing queue, we need to keep track of two indices, front and rear.
We en-queue an item at the rear and dequeue an item from front.
