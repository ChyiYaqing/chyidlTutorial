Profiling and optimizing Python code
When to optimize?
    Do you need optimization?
        if speed is not a problem, then there is no reason to optimize
    If yes: Which parts of your code should be optimized?
        Use a profiler, such as cProfile
        Usually, almost all execution time occurs within a small part of code
        Optimize that code, and leae the rest alone
    If you need even better performance
        Redesign the code completely
        But this takes effort!

cProfile and profile provide deterministic profiling of Python programs.
A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long
various parts of the program executed. These statistics can be formatted into
reports via the pstats module.

1. cProfile is recommended for most user;
2. profile, a pure Python module whose interface is imitated by cProfile.
