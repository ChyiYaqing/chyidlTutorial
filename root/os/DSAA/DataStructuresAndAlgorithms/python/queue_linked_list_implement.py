"""
Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in
which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out(FIFO).

In Queue data structure, we maintain two pointers, front and rear. The front
points the first item of queue and rear points to last item.

enQueue() : This operation adds a new node after rear and moves rear to the
    next node.
deQueue() : This operation removes the front node and moves front to the next
    node.
