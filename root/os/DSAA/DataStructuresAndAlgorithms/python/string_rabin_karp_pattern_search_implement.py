"""
Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Pattern Searching
    Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function
    search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in
    txt[]. You may assume that n > m

Rabin Karp algorithm matches the hash value of the pattern with the hash value
of current substring of text, and if the hash values match then only it starts
matching individual characters. So Rabin Karp algorithm needs to calculate hash
values for following strings.

"""
# Following program is the python implementation of Rabin Karp Algorithm given
# d is the number of characters in the input alphabet
d = 256

# pat   -> pattern
# txt   -> text
# q     -> A prime number


def rabin_karp_search(pat, txt, q):
    M, N = len(pat), len(txt)
    p = 0  # hash value for pattern
    t = 0  # hash value for txt
