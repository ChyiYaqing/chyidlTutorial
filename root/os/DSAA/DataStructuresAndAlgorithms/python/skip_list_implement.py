Skip List: create multiple layers so that we can skip some nodes.

Insert an Elements in Skip List
    start from highest level in the list and compare key of next node of the
    current node with the key to be inserted.
    1) Key of next node is less than key to be inserted then we keep on moving
    forward on the same level
    2) key of next node is greater than the key to be inserted then we store
    the pointer to current node i at update[i] and move one level down and
    continue our search
    At the level 0, we will definitely find a position to insert given key.

Following is the psuedo code for the insertion algorithm
    Insert(list, searchKey)
    local update[0...MaxLevel+1]
    x := list->header
    for i := list-level downto 0 do
