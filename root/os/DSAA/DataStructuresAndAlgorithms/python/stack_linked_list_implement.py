Stack Data Structure
Stack is a linear data structure. The order may be LIFO(Last in First Out)
of FILO(First In Last Out).

Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:
    Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to
        be Overflow condition
    Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed
        order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, the it is said
        to be an Underflow condition
    Peek or Top: Returns top element of stack
    isEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, elese false.

Stack Insertion and Deletion happen on same end.
Time Complexities of operations on stack:
    push(),pop(),isEmpty() and peek() all take O(1) time.

Implementing Stack using Linked List
    Pros:The linked list implementation of stack can grow and shrink according
        to needs at runtime.
    Cons: Requires extra memory due to involvement of points

Using a stack to evaluate postfix
    1) Starting at the beginning of the expression, get one term (operator or
    operand) at a time.
        a) If the term is an operand, push it on the stack.
        b) If the term is an operator, pop two operands off the stack, perform
        the operation on them, and push the result back on the stack
    2) When you get to the end of the expression, there should be exactly one
    operand left on the stack. That operand is the result.
