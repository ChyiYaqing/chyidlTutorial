Debugging and Profiling
=======================
* Debugger enables you to step through code, analyze stack frames and set breakpoints etc.,
* Profilers run code and give you a detailed breakdown of execution times, allowing you to identify bottlenecks in your programs.

bdb - Debugger framework
------------------------
The bdb module handles basic debugger functions, like setting breakpoints or managing execution via the debugger. 

The Python Profilers
--------------------
cProfile and profile provide deterministic profiling of Python programs. A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed. These statistics can be formatted into reports via the pstats module.
