QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and
partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different
versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.
    1. Always pick first element as pivot
    2. Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
    3. Pick a random element as pivot
    4. Pick median as pivot.

Pseudo Code for recursive QuickSort function:
    /* low --> Starting index, high --> Ending index */
    quickSort(arr[], low, high)
    {
        if (low < high)
        {
            /* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now
            at right place */
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)

            quickSort(arr, low, pi- 1) // Before pi
            quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high)// After pi
        }
    }

Partition Algorithm:
"""


# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort
# This function takes last element as pivot, places the pivot element
# at its correct position in sorted array, and places all smaller (smaller
# than pivot) to left of pivot and all greater elements to right of pivot
def partition(arr, low, high):
    i = (low - 1)  # index of smaller element
    pivot = arr[high]  # pivot

    for j in range(low, high):
        # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            # increment index of smaller element
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
    return i+1


# The main function that implements QuickSort
# arr[] --> Array to be sorted,
# low --> Starting index
# high --> Ending index


# Function to do Quick sort
def quickSort(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        # pi is partitioning index, arr[p] is now at right place
        pi = partition(arr, low, high)

        # Separately sort elements before partition and after partiton
        quickSort(arr, low, pi-1)
        quickSort(arr, pi+1, high)


# Driver code to test above
arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
print("Original array is {}".format(arr))
quickSort(arr, 0, len(arr)-1)
print("Sorted array is {}".format(arr))
