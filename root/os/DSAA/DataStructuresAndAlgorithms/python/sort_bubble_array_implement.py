"""
Bubble Sort is the simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping
the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

Optimized Implementation:
    The below function always runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted. It
    be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didn't cause any swap.
