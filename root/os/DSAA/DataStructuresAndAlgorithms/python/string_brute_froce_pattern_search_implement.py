Brute Force: Naive algorithm for Pattern Searching
    Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1],write a function
    search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in
    txt[]. assume that n > m

Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do
search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern
searching algorithms are used to show the search results.
