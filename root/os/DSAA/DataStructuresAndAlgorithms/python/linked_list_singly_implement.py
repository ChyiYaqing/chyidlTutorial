Implementing a Singly Linked List in Python

Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location, the elements are
linked using pointers.

Linked list Advantages over Arrays:
    1) Dynamic size
    2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Linked list Drawbacks over Arrays:
    1) Random access is not allowed.
    2) Extra memory space for a pointers is required with each element of the
    list.
    3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there
    is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked list.

Linked list Representation:
    Each node in a list consists of at least two parts
        1) data
        2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node

Linked list Insert a New Node
    1) At the front of the linked list
    2) After a given node.
    3) At the end of the linked list

To delete a node from linked list
    1) Find previous node of the node to be deleted
    2) Change the next of previous node
    3) Free memory for the node to be deleted
