"""
A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous
pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked
list.

Advantages over singly linked list
    1) A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction
    2) The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to
    be deleted is given
    3) can quickly insert a new node before a given node

Disadvantages over singly linked list
    1) Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer.
    2) All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained

Insertion : A node can be added in four ways
    1) At the front of the DLL
    2) After a given node
    3) At the end of the DLL
    4) Before a given node

Delete a node in a Doubly Linked List
    1) If node to be deleted is head node, then change the head pointer to
    next current head.
    2) Set next of previous to del, if previous to del exists.
    3) Set prev of next to del, if next to del exists.

Reverse a Doubly Linked List
    All we need to do is swap prev and next pointers for all nodes,change prev
    of the head (or start) and change the head pointer in the end
