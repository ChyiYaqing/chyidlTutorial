Selection Sort:
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum
element(considering ascending order)from unsorted part and putting it at the
beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
    1) The Subarray which is already sorted
    2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascendin
order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray
"""


# Python program for implementation of Selection Sort
def selectionSort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Find the minimum element in remaining unsorted array
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[min_idx] > arr[j]:
                min_idx = j
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]


# Driver code to test above
