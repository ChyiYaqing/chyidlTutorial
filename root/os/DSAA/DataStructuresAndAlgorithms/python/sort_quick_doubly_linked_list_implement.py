# The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.
# The ones who see things differently. They're not found
# of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
# You can quote them, disagree with them, glority or vilify
# them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
# Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
# And while some may see them as the creazy ones, we see genius.
# Because the poeple who are crazy enough to think thay can change
# the world, are the ones who do."
