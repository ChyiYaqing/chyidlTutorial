Hashing is an improvement over Direct Access Table. Use hash function
that convert any other key to a smaller number and uses the small numbers
as index in a table called hash table.

A good hash function should have following properties:
    1) Efficiently computable
    2) Should uniformly distribute the keys

Collision Handling:
    1) Separate Chaining: The idea is to make each cell of hash table point to
    a linked list of records that have smae hash function value.
        Advantages:
            a) Simple to implement
            b) Hash table never fills up
            c) Less sensitive to the hash function or load factors
            d) It is mostly used when it is unknown how many and how frequently
            keys may be inserted or deleted

        Disadvantages:
            a) Cache performance of chaining is not good as keys are stored use
            linked list.  Open addressing provides better cache performance as
            everything is stored in same table
            b) Wastage of Space (Some Parts of hash table are never used)
            c) If the chain becomes long, then search time can be become O(n)
            in worst case.
            d) Uses extra space for links

    2) Open Addressing: In open addressing, all elements are stored in the hash
    table itself.
        a) Linear Probing: In linear probing, linearly probe for next slot.
        b) Quadratic Probing: looking for i^2th slot in i'th iteration
        c) Double Hashing: use another hash function hash2(x) and look for
        i*hash2(x) slot in i'th rotation

Hashing in Distributed Systems:
    A distributed system is a network that consists of autonomous computers
    that are connected using a distribution middleware. They help in sharing
    different resources and capabilities to provide users with a single and
    integrated coherent network.

    The hash function can be defined as node_number = hash(key)mod_N where N
    is the number of Nodes.

Consistent Hashing:ä¸€è‡´æ€§å“ˆå¸Œç®—æ³•
    This method operates independently of the number of nodes as the hash
    function is not dependent on the number of nodes.

    The hash value can be computed as position_on_chain = hash(key)mod_360
Steps for the arrangement -
    1) Find Hash values of the keys and place it on the ring according to the
    hash value.
    2) Find Hash values of the individual nodes and place it on the ring
    according to the hash value.
    3) Now map each key with the node which is closest to it in the
    counter-clockwise disrection
    4) If the position of a node and key is same, assign that key to the node.

This is how consistent hashing sloves the rehashing problem. The number of keys
which needs to be redistributed after rehashing is minimized.

MPI - Distributed Computing
    Advantages of Distributed Computing
        1) Highly efficient
        2) Scalability
        3) Less tolerant to failures
        4) High Availability

    What is MPI?
        Message Passing Interface(MPI) is a standardized and portable
        message-passing system developed for distributed and parallel
        computing.
