Heap Data Structure
    A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a
    complete binary tree.

Heaps can be of two types:
    1) Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be
    greatest among the keys present at all of it's children. The same property
    must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

    2) Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum
    among the keys present at all of it's children. The same property must be
    recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

How is Binary Heap represented?
    A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A binary heap is typically
    represented as an array.
    1) The root element will be at Arr[0]
    2) Below table shows indexes of other nodes for the ith node,
        Arr[(i-1)/2]  Returns the parent node
        Arr[(2*i)+1]  Returns the left child node
        Arr[(2*i)+2]  Returns the right child node
