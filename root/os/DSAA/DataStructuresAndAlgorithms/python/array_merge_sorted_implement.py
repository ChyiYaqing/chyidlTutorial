Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.

Method 1: Merge two sorted arrays with O(1) extra space
    merge two array such that the initial numbers (after complete sorting) are
    in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array. Extra
    space allowed in O(1).

    This task is simple and O(m+n) if we are allowed to use extra space. But it
    be-comes really complicated when extra space is not allowed and doesn't
    look posible in less the O(m*n) worst case time.

    The idea is to begin from last element of arr2[] and search it in arr1[].
    if these is a greater element in arr1[], then we move last element of
    arr1[] to arr2[]. To keep arr1[] and arr2[] sorted, we need to place last
    element of arr2[] at correct place in arr1[]. Using Insertion Sort type
