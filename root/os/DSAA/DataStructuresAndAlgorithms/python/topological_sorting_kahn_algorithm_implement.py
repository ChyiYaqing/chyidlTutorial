"""
Kahn's algorithm for Topological Sorting: Topological sorting for
Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for
every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Algorithm:
    1) Compute in-degree(number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex
    present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

    2) Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue
    (Enqueue operation)

    3) Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then:
        a) Increment count of visited nodes by 1
        b) Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighbording nodes
        c) if in-degree of a neighbording nodes is reduced to zero, then add it
        to the queue

    4) Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty

    5) If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the
    graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph
