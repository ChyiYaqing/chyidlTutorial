1. Implement an array that supports dynamic expansion
    A synamic array is similar to an array, but with the difference that its
size can be dy-namically modified at runtime. The elements of an array occupy a
contiguous block of memory, and once created, its size cannot be changed. A
dynamic array can, once the array is filled, allo-cate a bigger chunk of memory
copy the contents from the original array to this new space, and continue to
fill the avilable slots.

The key is to provide means to grows an array A that stores the elemnts of a
list. We can't actually grow the array, its capacity is fixed. If an element is
appended to a list at a time, when the underlying array is full, we need to
perform following steaps.

1. Allocate a new array B with larger capacity (A commonly used rule for the
new array is to have twice the capacity of the existing array)

2. Set B[i]=A[i], for i=0 to n-1 where n denotes the current no if items.

3. Set A = B that is, we hence forth use B as the arry of supporting list.

4. Insert new element in the new array.
