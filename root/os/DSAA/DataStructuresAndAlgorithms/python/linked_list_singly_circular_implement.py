"""
Circular Linked List is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a
circle. There is no NULL at the ned. A circular linked list can be a singly
circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

1) Any node can be a starting point.

2) Useful for implementation fo queue.

3) Circular lists are useful in applications to repreatedly go around the list.

4) Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data
structures like Fibonacci Heap.

Implementation:
    To implement a circular singly linked list, we take an external pointer
    that points to the last node of the list. If we have a pointer last
    pointing to the last node, then last->next will point to the first node.
