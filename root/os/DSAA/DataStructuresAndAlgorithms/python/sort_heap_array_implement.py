"""
HeapSort is a comparsion based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data
structure.

What is Binary Heap?
    1) A complete binary tree: is a binary tree in which every level, except
    possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as
    possible.

    A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special
    order that value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in
    its two children nodes. The former is called as max heap and the latter is
    called min heap. The heap can be represented by binary tree or array.

Why array based representating for Binary Heap?
    Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented
    as array and array based representation is space efficient. If the parent
    node is stored at index i, the left child can be calculated by 2*i+1 and
    right child by a*i+2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).

    left = 2*i + 1  # left = 2*i + 1

    # See if left child of root exists and is greater than root
    if left < n and arr[i] < arr[left]:
