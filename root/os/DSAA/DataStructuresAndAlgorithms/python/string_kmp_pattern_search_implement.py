KMP Algorithm for Pattern Searching

KMP (knuth Morris Pratt) Pattern Searching, The basic idea behind KMP's
algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), we already
know some of the characters in the text of the next window. We take advantage
of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway
match.
