"""
Bucket Sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.

bucketSort(arr[], n)
    1) Create n empty buckets (Or lists).
    2) Do following for every array element arr[i].
        Insert arr[]i into bucket[n*array[i]]
    3) Sort indicidual buckets using quick sort
    4) Concatenate all sorted buckets.

# Python3 program to sort an array using bucket sort

# than pivot) to left of pivot and all greater elements to right of pivot
