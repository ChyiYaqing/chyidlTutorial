"""
Circular Linked List is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a
circle. There is no NULL at the end. A Circular linked list can be a singly
circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
    1) Any node can be a strating point.
    2) Useful for implementation of queue.
    3) Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the
    list.
    4) Circular Doubly Linked lists are used for implementation of advanced
    data structures like Fibonacci Heap
