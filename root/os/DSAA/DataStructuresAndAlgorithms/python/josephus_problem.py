"""
In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus Probelm is a theoretical
problem.

There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting
out be-gins at some point in the circle and processeds around the circle in a
fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the
next person is executed.The elimination proceeds around the circle, until only
the last person remains, who is given freedom. Given the total number of
persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth
person is killed in circle.  The task is to choose the place in the initial
circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.

1) Following is simple recursive implementation of the Josephus problem.

    After the first person (kth from beginning) is killed, n-1 persons are left
    So we call josephus(n-1, k) to get the position with n-1 persons. But the
    position returned by josephus(n-1, k) will consider the position starting
    from k%n .
