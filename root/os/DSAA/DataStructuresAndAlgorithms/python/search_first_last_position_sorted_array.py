Find first and last positions of an element in a sorted array

Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find
indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.

The Naive Approach is to run a for loop and check given element in array
    1) Run a for loop and for i = 0 to n-1
    2) take first  = -1 and last = -1
    3) When we find element first time then we update first  = i
    4) We always update last=i whenever we find the element
    5) We print first and last

Using binary search

1. For first occurrence of a number
    a) If (high >= low)
    b) Calculate mid = low + (high-low)/2
    c) If (mid == 0 || x > arr[mid-1]) && arr[mid] == x
        return mid;
    d) Else if (x > arr[mid])
        reurn first(arr, (mid+1), high, x, n)
    e) Else:
        return first(arr, low, (mid-1), x, n)
    f) Otherwise return -1;

2. For last occurrence of a number
    a) if (high >= low)
    b) calculate mid = low + (high - low)/2
    c) if((mid == n-1 || x < arr[mid+1]) && arr[mid] == x)
        return mid
    d) else if(x < arr[mid])
        return last(arr, low, (mid-1), x, n)
    e) else
        return last(arr, (mid + 1), high, x, n)
    f) otherwise return -1
