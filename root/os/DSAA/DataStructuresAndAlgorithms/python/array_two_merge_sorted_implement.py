Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.

Method 1: Merge two sorted arrays with O(1) extra space
    merge two array such that the initial numbers (after complete sorting) are
    in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array. Extra
    space allowed in O(1).

    This task is simple and O(m+n) if we are allowed to use extra space. But it
    be-comes really complicated when extra space is not allowed and doesn't
    look posible in less the O(m*n) worst case time.

Below is algorithm:
    1) Iterate through every element of ar2[] starting from last element. Do following for every element ar2[i]
    a) Store last element of ar1[j]: last = ar1[j]
    b) Loop for last element of ar1[] while element ar1[j] is smaller than ar2[i].
        ar1[j+1] = ar1[j]  // Move element one position ahead
        j--
    c) If any element of ar1[] was moved or (j != m-1)
        ar1[j+1] = ar2[i]
        ar2[i] = last

Method 2 (O(n1 + n2) Time and O(n1 + n2) Extra Space)
    The idea is to use Merge function of Merge sort.
    1. Create an array ar3[] of size n1 + n2
    2. Simultaneously traverse ar1[] and ar2[].
        Pick smaller of current elements in ar1[] and ar2[], copy this
        smaller element to next position in ar3[] and move ahead in ar3[]
        and the array whose element is picked.
    3. If these are remaining elements in ar1[] or ar2[], copy them also in
    ar3[]
