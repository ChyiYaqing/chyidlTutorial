# RaspberryPi Tutorial 


## WiringPi Tutorial 

WiringPi is a PIN based GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835(Raspberry Pi Zero), BCM2836(Raspbe    rry Pi Model 2B) and BCM2837 (Raspberry Pi Model 3B) SoC devices used in all Raspberry Pi.

WiringPi includes a command-line utility gpio which can be used to program and setup the GPIO pins. You can use this to read and write the pins and even use it control them from shell scripts.

### Download and Install

![# gpio -v](/imgs/raspberrypi/RaspberryPi_gpio-v.png?raw=true)
- [$ gpio -v # check that wiringPi is not already installed]()

If you get something, then you have it already installed.
