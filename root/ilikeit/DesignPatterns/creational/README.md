Creational design patterns
==========================

1. Abstrat Factory
------------------
Creates an instance of several families of classes 
    - Intent
        * Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
        * A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products"
        * The **new** operator considered harmful 
    - 


2. Builder 
----------
Separates object construction from its representation 


3. Factory Method 
-----------------
Creates an instance of several derivel classes 


4. Object Pool 
--------------
Avoid expensive acquistion and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use 


5. Prototype 
------------
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned 


6. Singleton 
------------
A class of which only a single instance can exist
