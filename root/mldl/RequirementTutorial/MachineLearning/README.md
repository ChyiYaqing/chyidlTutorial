# Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is a filed of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ablitity to "learn" from data, without being explicity programmed. 

Machine learning is closely related to compuatational statistics, It has strong ties to mathematical optimization

## Machine learning tasks

1. Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. 
2. Semi-supervised learning: The computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing 
3. Active learning: The computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling.
4. Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. 
5. Reinforcement learning: Data are given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent.

## Machine learning applications

1. classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one to more of these classes.  Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email and the classes are "spam" and "not spam". 
2. regression, also a supervided problem, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. 
3. clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, marking this typically an unsupervised task. 

## List of machine learning algorithms 

In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programed." Machine learning explores the study and construction of algrothms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from an example training set of input observations in order to make data-driven predctions or decisions expressed as outputs, rather than following strictly static program instructions.
