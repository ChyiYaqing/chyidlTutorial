# Parctical Python3 and OpenCV 

Computer vision is to understand the story unfolding in a picture. As huamns, this is quite simple. But for computers, the task is extremely difficult.

Facial recognition is an application of computer vision in the real world.Another popular application of computer vision is surveillance.

Computer vision is now prevalent in many areas of yourlife, whether your realize is or not.


## Requirements:

- NumPy is a library for the Python programming language that (among other things) provides supports for large, multi-dimensional arrays.
- SciPy is Scientific Computing Tools for Python.
- matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality firgures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive across platforms.
- OpenCV is real-time image processing, but it wasn't until the 2.0 release in 2009 that we saw the incredible NumPy support. The library itself is written in C/C++, but Python binding are provided.
- Mahotas is a computer vision and image precessing library for Python.Much of the functionality implemented in Mahotas can be found in OpenCV, but in some cases, the Mahotas interface is just easier to use.
- Scikit-Learn is Machine Learning in Python. Scikit-learn also includes a handful of image feature extraction functions as well.
